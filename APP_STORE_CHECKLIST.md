# HushMap App Store Submission Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Submission

### 1. Privacy Policy & Terms of Service
**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING - REQUIRED**

Apple **requires** a privacy policy URL for apps that:
- Collect location data ‚úì (you do)
- Use health data ‚úì (Watch app uses HealthKit)
- Have user accounts ‚úì (Google/Apple Sign-In)
- Use third-party services ‚úì (Google Maps, OpenAI)

**What you need:**
- Host privacy policy online (can be on GitHub Pages, your website, etc.)
- Add link in App Store Connect during submission
- Optionally add to AboutView in the app

**Minimum privacy policy must cover:**
- What data you collect (location, health, user profiles)
- How you use it (maps, AI predictions, reports)
- Third-party services (Google Maps, OpenAI, Firebase if used)
- Data retention and deletion
- User rights (GDPR compliance)

### 2. Account Deletion
**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING - REQUIRED for apps with accounts**

Apple requires apps with account creation to provide **in-app account deletion**.

**Current issue:** You have Google/Apple Sign-In but no delete account option.

**Fix needed in ProfileView:**
- Add "Delete Account" button
- Implement account deletion flow
- Delete all user data (reports, profile, etc.)
- Show confirmation dialog

### 3. API Keys Security
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPOSED IN INFO.PLIST**

Your API keys are visible in Info.plist:
```xml
<key>GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY</key>
<string>$(GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY)</string>
```

**Recommendations:**
- ‚úÖ Good: Using build config variables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider: Move to backend API for production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Add API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Add OpenAI usage limits/monitoring
