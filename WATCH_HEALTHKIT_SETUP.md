# Environmental Sound Integration Setup

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

I've integrated Apple Watch's environmental sound monitoring into HushMap! This allows the Watch app to:

1. **Display live noise levels** in decibels (dB) on both Glance and Log views
2. **Color-coded indicators** based on sound intensity:
   - 🟢 Green: < 50 dB (Quiet - library, bedroom)
   - 🟡 Yellow: 50-70 dB (Moderate - conversation, office)
   - 🟠 Orange: 70-85 dB (Loud - busy street, alarm)
   - 🔴 Red: > 85 dB (Very Loud - hearing damage risk)
3. **Real-time emoji feedback** based on current environment
4. **Automatic monitoring** when app is active
5. **Integration with Apple's health data** - uses the same sensor that powers Apple's "Environmental Sound Levels" feature

## 🔧 Required Setup in Xcode

### 1. Add HealthKit Capability

**HushMapWatch Watch App target:**
1. Select **HushMapWatch Watch App** target
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
3. Click **"+ Capability"**
4. Add **HealthKit**
5. Under HealthKit → Background Delivery → Enable "Background Delivery"

### 2. Verify Info.plist

The required permission key has been added:
```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>HushMap uses environmental sound levels from your Apple Watch to help you track and log noise exposure in different locations.</string>
```

## 📱 How It Works

### Data Flow
```
Apple Watch Microphone
    ↓
watchOS Environmental Sound Monitoring
    ↓
HealthKit (stores dB readings)
    ↓
HushMap Watch App (reads via EnvironmentalSoundMonitor)
    ↓
Display in UI + Auto-log suggestions
```

### User Experience

**GlanceView:**
- Shows live sound level badge at the top: "🔊 65 dB 🙂"
- Updates continuously while app is open
- Color changes based on intensity

**LogView:**
- Shows current sound level before logging
- Helps users make informed decisions
- "Current: 65 dB 🙂"

## 🎯 Features

### Automatic Categories
- **Quiet** (< 50 dB): 😌 Green - Comfortable for extended periods
- **Moderate** (50-70 dB): 🙂 Yellow - Safe for daily activities
- **Loud** (70-85 dB): 😕 Orange - Limit exposure time
- **Very Loud** (> 85 dB): 😣 Red - Hearing protection recommended

### Privacy
- Only reads environmental sound levels (ambient noise)
- Does NOT record audio
- Uses existing Apple Watch health data
- User must grant permission explicitly
- Can revoke access anytime in Watch Settings → Privacy → Health

## 🚀 Testing

1. **Enable Environmental Sound Monitoring on Watch:**
   - Watch Settings → Noise → Turn ON
   - Enable "Environmental Sound Measurements"
   - Wait a few minutes for data to collect

2. **Grant Permission in HushMap:**
   - Open HushMap Watch app
   - When prompted, allow access to Environmental Audio Exposure
   - Or manually: Watch Settings → Privacy → Health → HushMap → Enable Read

3. **Test in Different Environments:**
   - Quiet room: Should show < 50 dB, green
   - Normal conversation: ~60 dB, yellow
   - Busy street: ~70-80 dB, orange
   - Near construction: > 85 dB, red

## 📊 Sound Level Reference

| Environment | Typical dB | Category |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Library | 30-40 | Quiet |
| Whisper | 20-30 | Quiet |
| Normal conversation | 60-65 | Moderate |
| Office | 50-60 | Moderate |
| Busy restaurant | 70-80 | Loud |
| Lawn mower | 85-90 | Very Loud |
| Concert | 100-120 | Dangerous |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Apple Watch Series 4 or later required** - earlier models don't have the necessary sensors
2. **Environmental Sound Monitoring must be enabled** in Watch Settings
3. **Requires watchOS 6.0+** for environmental audio exposure data
4. **Data updates periodically** - not instantaneous (Apple's limitation)
5. **First use requires permission** - users will see HealthKit permission dialog

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Push notifications when entering loud environments
- [ ] Daily/weekly noise exposure summaries
- [ ] Automatic report creation when prolonged exposure detected
- [ ] Historical sound level charts
- [ ] Integration with WHO hearing health guidelines
- [ ] Smart suggestions: "This area has been quiet for others"

## 📝 Code Structure

**New Files:**
- `EnvironmentalSoundMonitor.swift` - Service that interfaces with HealthKit
  - Monitors environmental audio exposure
  - Provides real-time dB readings
  - Categorizes sound levels
  - Handles permissions

**Modified Files:**
- `GlanceView.swift` - Shows live sound level badge
- `LogView.swift` - Shows current sound level when logging
- `Info.plist` - Added HealthKit usage description

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Data-driven**: Uses actual sensor data, not guesswork
2. **Privacy-focused**: Read-only, no recording
3. **Apple integration**: Familiar permission flow
4. **Hearing health**: Raises awareness of noise exposure
5. **Better logging**: Users can see exact dB levels when reporting

**Status**: Code complete, requires Xcode capability setup
**Next Step**: Add HealthKit capability in Xcode and test on physical Watch
